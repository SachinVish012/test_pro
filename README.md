# test_pro

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- Configure firebase jsons file.
- I have added static data because No such data or API mentioned in test Doc.
- Add data with same key in your firebase realtime DataBase. 
- "saveAmount": "1000",
  "goalAmount":"2000",
  "savingAmount":"3000",
  "monthlySaving":"4000",
  "contribution": {
  "totalAmount1":"5000",
  "totalAmount2":"6000",
  }
- For Now I have added all, you can read check it.
- I have write cutom code here.
- For circular indicator/progress bar I have fixed value. We can change by calling API or other. Just we need to set the value and it will work.
